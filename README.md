The scope of this project is being changed from *playing* chess to *analyzing* games in a very particular way.  The problem of interest is that of *Retrograde Analysis*.  In general, this is the challenge of recreating previous game states from a mid-game state.  

Given the board state at turn $n$, this project seeks to recreate the game state after $n-1,\, n-2, \, \dots,\, 1, \, 0$ turns.  To accomplish this, deep learning on lots and lots of games.
